<p><img alt="Head shot of Nicolas Dudebout" src="/files/head_shot.png" class="img-rounded pull-left"/> I received a PhD from the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in 2014, advised by <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/jeff-shamma">Professor Jeff Shamma</a> and <a href="http://www.feron.org/Eric/">Professor Éric Féron</a>. My research focus was control theory with an emphasis on game theoretic learning. I received a Bachelor’s degree from <a href="http://www.centralesupelec.fr">Supélec</a> in 2007 and a Master’s degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008.</p>
<p>I am a strong believer in the benefits of reproducible research. Therefore, all the material needed to regenerate <a href="/publications">my publications and presentations</a> is available on GitHub.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The goal of my research is to enable a group of agents to control a dynamical system in a decentralized fashion through game-theoretic learning. This requires crafting a game whose equilibria are desirable controllers for the dynamical system and equipping the agents with learning rules that guarantee convergence to an equilibrium.</p>
<p>I study stochastic games in which the full-rationality requirement of game theory is restrictive. To circumvent this restriction, I introduced a bounded-rationality solution concept called empirical-evidence equilibrium (EEE). In the EEE framework, agents use low-order empirical models of observed quantities. These models are statistically consistent when the empirical evidence observed by an agent does not contradict its model. In an EEE, each agent has a consistent model of its opponents and plays a best response to its model. I am currently analyzing properties of EEEs.</p>
